            <h2>Why winter is better than summer</h2>
            <p>Winter is such a good season. Though there may be some people who hates it, but winter is such a good season because the COLD weather brings us together, like brings poeple together. We share the love and we feel better connection with each other
                Enjoying the holidays with your love ones and your friends brings you more close to one another and that is just the best feeling. Probably I like winter and hate summer is because that Christmas is my favorite holiday of the year and my skin is too sensitive to the heat.
                Winter is preferable than summer because you can relax on the couch with your family while sipping hot coco and wearing comfortable clothing, its justthe it's nicest feeling ever. I just hate summer because I don't want myself in the heat because I sweat easily and it irritates me.
                I also prefer outdoor activities during winter, ice skating, sledding and more. I do like some activities also during summer but that just depends on my mood if I want to do it ot not. In summer, you can't really enjoy being outside, you'll sweat a lot, and you'll most likely get sun burn.
                And the worst feeling is that when you are about to enter a car, gosh that is so bad for my experience. It's like you've entered a sauna. And you have to wait for your car A/C to get cold but that takes a while. Unlike winter, you do not need aircon for your house. The coldness comes inside your room and that just feels so good.
                But in summer, you either have to buy an aircon or an electric fan, and you'll just pay more bills for it. But for winter, you can enjoy and relax with thick blankets which is very comfortable. Another reason why winter is better than summer is because in winter, you can sleep easily, but for summer, the heat irritates you and it would be hard for people to sleep.

            <h2>Arguing AGAINST</h2>
            <p>I, of course disagree with Seojong's opinion, he stated that cold winter makes people wear thick clothes and it makes them exhausted. I fully disagree with it because in summer, the heat makes you feel tired easily. You need a big amount of energy for you to not to get tired but, the more you use your energy, the more tired you'll feel.
                Though he has a point about having penalty for not removing the snow in the yard, I have to agree with that because if I'm not mistaken, it's also a part of the law. I don't think that the sun can lift people's mood because it just the heat of the sun just irritates them.
